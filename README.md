# CSS-only Slot Machine #

[Demo](https://MERNCraft.github.io/casino)

This project simulates a slot machine, using the `@counter-style` at-rule to create custom list counters, the `transform: rotateX()` property, and some simple arithmetic to calculate how much to rotate each list item and which item number symbols to display.

The symbols are created using Unicode emojis.
